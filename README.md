# Excel-Sample-CaseStudies
I've practice Excel Formulas and Functions like SUMIF, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, AGGREGATE, COUNT, AVERAGE,etc. Use of Pivot table, Pivot Charts. I've also created Sample Dashboards by using different types of DataSet

- I've used different types of dataset from internet.
- After downloading different type of dataset I've studied the data and performed cleaning of dataset by performing actions like removing null values(empty cells), removing the unwanted rows/columns, adding or creating new columns where required like creating columns e.g. A column named Month like Dec from date like 1/12/2023, Converting data into reliable data form like Number, Date, Percentage, etc.
- After performing cleaning of dataset creating tables or charts as per requirement.
Creating Dashboards through charts.
- Creating Insights and Conclusion of data after creating Dashboards.
